# More-Informative-Item-Pick-Ups [Anniversary Update]
(You *can* call it MIIPU if you want)

This mod adds extra details to the items during pickup and in the logbooks. This is a mod for people who want the most amount of information about item damages, procs, stacking benefits, etc. Sometimes the wording can be a bit verbose, but the goal of this mod is to contain the all relevant information, regardless of word limit. That being said, if you have any suggestions/corrections regarding how things are worded, feel free to suggest them or make a pull request!

Huge thanks to The Assistance Importer and Nada Afterwards for contributing a lot of information and suggestions! Also special thanks to my friend, Failtronic2, for helping me find a lot of mistakes or poor wording. All these people have been a huge help while making this mod!
