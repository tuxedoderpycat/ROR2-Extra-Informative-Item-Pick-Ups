    "TOOLBOT_BODY_LORE": "\"OK. Everything checks out. You're free to go, pal.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot chirped in acknowledgement. It folded neatly unto itself and began rolling down the hangar's exit lane - at a very safe pace.\r\n\r\nHiroshi pulled a switch. The ceiling rail sprung to life, with a distinct mechanical chatter.\r\n\r\n\"So, what's wrong with this one?\" Rico enquired with minimal interest, seemingly distracted by the novel he had buried himself in.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like cosmetic damage on a MUL-T unit. Got dinged up by another unit in the charging bay that malfunctioned after another power surge. We'll be checking that one out after this. You can thank the electrical crew for that,\" Hiroshi remarked. \r\n\r\n\"Great. How hard is it for them to just keep things stable? They have robots doing 90% of their job anyway.\" Rico scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"We've got complaints on this unit about poor welding jobs, which might've been the cause. Optical calibration is probably off, so we'll also be taking a look at that while it's here. I'd still put money on it being electrical not keeping up with maintenance. Hey, Rico! Would you put that down and help me out?\"\r\n\r\nThe rail brought a bright yellow robot, slumbering, into the hangar. Hiroshi flipped the switch and the rail slowed to a halt, bringing with it silence. He began moving to unhook the robot. Reluctantly, Rico set his book on the work desk and started to help unload. In a few minutes the robot was on the service platform.\r\n\r\nHiroshi walked over to one of the tool cabinets and pulled out a strange device. He popped open the access panel to the unit's dented head, and began probing at the damage from the opposite side. In no time at all, the tool beeped and kicked back violently. The dent was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Go put this away while I fix the optics,\" Hiroshi said, one arm stretched behind his back, device in hand. \"I have something I want to show you in a sec.\"\r\n\r\nRico grunted and took the de-denting tool back to the cabinet. Hiroshi was already soldering away with the iron from his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis caught Rico's interest. \r\n\r\n\"You don't need a soldering iron to fix the calibration. What are you doing?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I already fixed the optics. Remember when I said I wanted to show you something cool - the next time we got a MUL-T in the shop? Come here.\" said Hiroshi, gesturing. \"You see these two chips? It’s actually just one chip that's been split. MUL-T’s come with the same cores as those fancy chef bots, but they cut off access to the main learning module.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say,\" Rico responded, still trying to see the chip Hiroshi was talking about. \"Why'd they do something like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's cheaper to just make all the cores the same way at the factory and alter them later. The manufacturer says it's for safety, but they just use it to sell you the new cores every few years instead of letting you just teach the units to do a new job.\" Hiroshi explained.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds about right. If it were a safety issue, why don't they do the same thing with the chef bots? They've been super stable. Can't say they've even ever got an order wrong, even if it's totally out there. They even managed to get Ma's Squid Risotto right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what they can get away with. Anyway, that should do it. We'll just sneak a few minutes with this guy. Wake up,\" he commanded.\r\n\r\nThe robot's relaxed posture disappeared, and it stood fully alert.\r\n\r\n\"Hey pal, you see this thing I'm doing with my hand? Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot mimicked a rude gesture.\r\n\r\n\"That's fantastic! You're doing great!\" Hiroshi was excited, and Rico got a devilish grin. He rushed off to his desk. Hiroshi continued repeating the gesture, and the robot continued mimicking it back with its single functional hand. Rico stepped back into the robot's view, with a picture covered in holes. \"Can you remember this man? This is Ron from corporate, and he's a total degenerate.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation.\r\n\r\n\"Can you do that next time you see this man?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation again.\r\n\r\n\"Rico! He's gonna remember that! MUL-T, forget that.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot did not respond.\r\n\r\n\"What are you two up to now?\" said a grating voice, clearly approaching from no discernable direction. In a panic, Hiroshi slapped the access panel on the unit's head closed and covered its optical sensor.\r\n\r\n\"Just fixing up robots! Doing our job! In fact, we just finished with this one. You're good to go, pal!\" Hiroshi exclaimed to Ron, slapping the robot on the back. The machine folded up neatly into itself and began rolling down the hangar's exit lane.\r\n\r\n\"I see. I'd better not catch you two slacking again.\" Ron said sternly, before turning around and making his usual relieving exit – most likely to pester other workers on his route.\r\n\r\nThey both let out a sigh of relief. Rico stood up. \"Well, we're due at the site in about… 13 hours. That's enough time to grab that MUL-T, pop it back open, and reset it.\"\r\n\r\nHiroshi also stood up. “Yeah, I’m not too worried. How much trouble could it cause in 13 hours?”\r\n",

They paid no mind to the feathered figure as she darted through closing blast doors.\r\n\r\nShe flew quickly down the halls of the ship. Despite it being her first time onboard a human vessel, she could sense the electromagnets in the walls – and where they all joined. She corked right, shooting into the ventilation shafts with a bang.\r\n\r\nThe captain barely had a chance to see her before she blasted sideways out into the control room. She tore out two windblades as he reached for his pistol. The captain fell to the ground in intervals. \r\n\r\nHer momentum crashed her into the control panels, both feet digging deep into monitors. She didn’t need those. Nimble, clawed fingers began ripping across keypads. She quickly split and rewired components, reaching into her feathered pouches for more bridges and other electronics. Various capacitors fell onto the floor. This ship was big, but not complex – and more importantly, it could still fly. But she had to go fast, or he –\r\n\r\nAnd before she could finish her thought, he appeared in a flash of thunder. Blue and green light reflected off of his sword, cascading around the bridge. A cape fluttered, and Providence landed lightly on his feet.\r\n\r\nKur-skan bent her head backwards over her body, hands still tearing at panels. He was much faster than she expected.

Five eyes.\r\n\r\n• The Beetle has two armor-like chitin plates on its head and back, presumably for defense. It seems to secrete a waxy substance.\r\n\r\n• Beetles appear to be social in nature, with a hierarchy I cannot discern. I witnessed a group of 4 beetles resting under a tree, when a stray fifth came around. They promptly sprang up and repeatedly head-butted the creature until it left, battered and bruised.\r\n\r\n• Tharson has reported to me that the Beetles are highly aggressive and territorial. \r\n",

The Guard has the same 5 eyes as the Worker's, with one of them protruding from the top of its head. This most likely allows the Guard to see while keeping its head down in a defensive position.\r\n\r\n• The Guard appears higher in the social hierarchy than the Worker. I have witnessed Workers scatter when a Guard appeared.\r\n\r\n• The Guard’s chitin plates extend to cover its entire body, with only joints revealing the thinner, darker exoskeleton below. \r\n\r\n• Tharson has reported that the Guard’s chitin is significantly sturdier than the Workers. We have consumed many resources to fell this magnificent creature, including our disposable missile launcher. Tharson’s battle with the Guard lasted for about an hour before it finally succumbed.

Long nights and unnaturally regular eclipses have made sunlight scarce and we must, appallingly, resort to risking our lives hunting and devouring the local fauna like lowly beasts. While the air is breathable, it is no blessing; we have been unable to escape the foul smell that we can only now assume is simply a part of the atmosphere on this world. Worst of all, attempts to return through the portal have been unsuccessful in our weakened state. It takes considerable effort to enter [the between space] - and we lack the strength to stay there long enough to cross the membrane. We are stranded.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the master of this world. Curiously, it is in his presence that we find ourselves most weakened - and when he senses us, he wastes no time in his approach. We've attempted to kill him once in the hopes of restoring our access to the portal, and it ended in such disaster that it became clear there could not be a second attempt. If not for our ability to briefly dive into [the between space] to escape our skirmishes, we would surely all be butchered.\r\n\r\nWhenever we can observe him unnoticed, he stands in the open, transfixed by the moon. I find some small humor in that.\r\n\r\nCurse this place - and curse its master. May we find a way to send word to the homeworld of our plight -and may the great emperor deign to come forth and grant this \"deity\" a swift death.\r\n\r\n-- End of Recording --\r\n\r\n-- End of Excerpt Flagged for Review --\r\n\r\n> TRANSLATION ERRORS: 1\r\n> 1> [the between space] could not be fully translated.\r\n\r\n> Please refer to report 3bb540efade7e4df993c5d6c118830e7 for full audio excerpt.\r\n==============================================================\r\n",

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nToday, we’ve seen our first form of outer life on this planet, merely a few hours after our untimely landing.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Icarian Jellyfish’.\r\n\r\n• Large, round invertebrate, about 2m in diameter, with two trailing tentacles. They shimmer a white-blue. They greatly resemble Medusozoa from Earth. \r\n\r\n• They seem to be experiencing neutral buoyancy in this planet’s atmosphere, causing them to float. I theorize this is due to a unique gas composition inside of their hull, which they expel to traverse.\r\n\r\n• When observed, these Jellyfish seem to bathe in the sun, slowly rotating their bodies as they do so. They may be cold-blooded.\r\n\r\n• By my request, Tharson approached a lone Jellyfish. After detecting his presence, it began to glow, quiver, and pulse before suddenly detonating with a brilliant flash and a loud bang, causing severe burns and temporary blindness to Tharson. I theorize that by exciting the gases inside of their hulls, these Jellyfish can ignite those gases and explode, scorching everything nearby. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n",

Tracing the trajectory, we followed the projectiles’ path to its source, a large crustacean-like creature.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned its common name as “Forhamian Hermit Crab.”\r\n\r\n* The Crab disguises itself as a stalagmite – careful observation can reveal the Crab’s true identity.\r\n\r\n* The Crabs dislike up-close contact with prey, fleeing upon approach. It attacks from exclusively long-range by expelling balls of mucus and body waste with incredible force.\r\n\r\n* The Crabs don’t seem to have eyes – often stumbling around and bumping into walls. How they can locate targets from a long-range with decent accuracy is currently unknown.\r\n\r\n* The Crabs seem to have “favorite shells.” I observed several specimens clearly too large for their shells, only ditching their shells once they are damaged and forced to find a new one. Some Crabs also seem to have favorite materials that they prefer.\r\n",

While walking through the wetlands, we must have triggered some sort of alarm, as these mysterious beings assembled themselves and quickly descended upon us. I will describe their properties below. I have assigned their common name as “Brass Contraption.”\r\n\r\n* They are capable of flinging spiked artillery with incredible force. Tharson swiftly dodged the Contraption’s fire, yet it still punched through a nearby tree with little effort, toppling it.\r\n\r\n* They appear to sense their surroundings targets through echo-location. They constantly emit a low ringing sound from a bell-like device at their core, and their accuracy was substantially affected after Tharson landed a clean blow on the bell, denting the device.\r\n\r\n* They are constructed of an alien alloy currently under investigation by our friends on the science team. It resembles Earthen brass, yet appears to have durability and toughness more resembling steel.\r\n\r\n* How the Contraptions function is still a mystery, as they possess no circuitry or onboard computers. Whatever force animates them must be unique to this planet, as no level of technology this advanced has ever been documented.\r\n",

From the sound of it, the Templar wasn’t alone – it had company.\r\n\r\nHe had left his shelter to scrounge for supplies – not that there was much to find in the desert – when he was assaulted by a new kind of monster. Resembling a man, the creature stood around seven to eight feet tall, with skin made of tar and elaborate accessories of clay decorating its body. \r\n\r\nHe had had only a few moments to stifle his surprise as the Templar opened fire, spewing a barrage of tar pellets from the enormous pot it carried. The survivor ran, but the Templar scored several hits. The tar had seeped into his suit, and he was starting to lose sensation in his legs.\r\n\r\nA brief spark of hope – the survivor had some medical supplies in his shelter. If he could only make it back, he may be able to treat his leg and remove the tar…\r\n\r\nThat spark was quickly extinguished in a hail of bullets.\r\n",

Again, and again.\r\n\r\nSo, I figured out its pattern.\r\n\r\nI waited for it, where it would appear next. My rifle was aimed at empty space - and then suddenly, that empty space became a target. But I couldn't pull the trigger. \r\n\r\nIt turned to look straight at me, and I was paralyzed. It wasn't fear, it was something else. It was talking into my brain. The words it used weren't any language I knew, but it compelled me to freeze. The experience wasn't something I can fully describe with words. I couldn't pull the trigger. I couldn't even reach for the radio. I couldn't turn to look away. While my head was ringing, it resumed its routine; I could only stand and watch. It finished its check, and then returned its attention to me, as though I were an afterthought. I could feel it take something from me, but I can't remember what it was. And then, it left.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it got whatever it wanted, because it hasn't been back since.\r\n\r\nSomething is still wrong with my head. I can't even seem to work up the power to speak.

We stepped away to observe this lifeform’s behavior from afar.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Parent’.\r\n\r\n• Tall, lumbering giants, eerily humanoid. Where you would expect to see a face there is only a hole, giving a blank look to them. Their ghostly skin appears to run like wax but even so it does not seem to congeal at their feet.\r\n\r\n• Their large hands have opposable thumbs. This could possibly mean that they have the capability for intelligence, using tools or testing their environment with dextrous manipulation.\r\n\r\n• If we hadn’t taken up this vantage point when we did, the creature would have been upon us before we realized it. Its distant footstep sounds betrayed how quickly it closed the distance.\r\n\r\n• I had Tharson throw a stone near the creature and suddenly any signs of intelligence faded, replaced with primal fury. Deadly, wild force rained down as it smashed the ground with its fists, searching for the perpetrator of its peaceful moment. Our ship was not OK from this encounter.\r\n",

Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Mini Mushrum’.\r\n\r\n• ‘Mini’ is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.\r\n\r\n• Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?\r\n\r\n• After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.\r\n",

However, her size is much greater than it should be for an insect queen. Does this mean that the Queen herself hunts rather than sending her drones?\r\n\r\n* The Beetle Queen issues orders via pheromone emission. Merely being in the presence of the Queen gave the air a sickly sweet aroma, and Tharson reported light-headedness and trouble thinking clearly.\r\n\r\n* The Queen’s bile is incredibly acidic, clocking in at a whopping 0.05 on the pH scale. Immediately upon exposure to a test sample of steel, it began to dissolve and spew noxious fumes. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The Queen is able to summon unique Beetle specimens that can fly. These drones do not appear anywhere else on the planet – do these drones act as attendants to the Queen?

A relative of the previously documented Icarian Jellyfish, this specimen dwarves its brethren several times over.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned its common name as “Icarian Vagrant”.\r\n\r\n* Massive in size. I wouldn’t believe the Vagrant is capable of flight had I not seen it myself. Like its smaller cousin, the Vagrant’s hull contains buoyant gases that allow it to fly. \r\n\r\n* These gases are easily excitable and produce incredible amounts of static electricity, cloaking the Vagrant in a protective aura that scorches anything that approaches. The Vagrants can also hurl charged nematocysts as a method of self-defense, as evidenced when I asked Tharson to approach a lone Vagrant. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The name of “Vagrant” was decided on by its nomadic nature. We trailed a lone specimen for several days. The Vagrant would wander from place to place, occasionally dipping down towards the ground to feel around with its tentacles. After a few minutes, it would ascend and continue on its path. Could the Vagrant be looking for something, indicating intelligence, or is this merely a hunting method?\r\n\r\n* When the clouds part, dozens of Vagrants can be seen lazily drifting throughout the sky, twinkling like stars. Despite their beauty, it raises a horrifying question – are the stars at night on this planet truly stars, or just more Vagrants? The answer can spell truly horrifying implications for our stay on this planet.",

After a brief quake, a massive serpentine creature, easily 50 feet long, erupted from the ground and arced through the air, knocking us off our feet. I will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as “Magma Worm”.\r\n\r\n* Upon inspection of its (now dead) body, I discovered multiple ports along its skin. These ports must allow it to propel itself forward, releasing a gaseous exhaust that is then ignited to give the worm its fiery appearance.\r\n\r\n* The size of the creature is something to behold. It must wield an incredible amount of energy, as the heat radiating off its body was enough to turn the earth it burrows through into smooth, glassy tunnels. It must either eat an incredible amount of food, or spend a long time hibernating under ground.\r\n\r\n* The worm’s body is incredibly conductive, retaining temperatures of over 350 degrees Fahrenheit for over ten hours after the beast was felled.\r\n\r\n* It appears that the worm is classically blind – what appear to be eyes are revealed to be symbiotes that grant the worm vision in exchange for protection against predators.

They are hostile on sight, but we hope to follow them back to their dens and observe their behavior when not hunting. I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Vermin\".\n\n* As their name suggests, the Vermin are blind, relying primarily on their acute senses of smell and hearing to navigate their environment.\n\n* They leave behind trails of body waste as they scurry to and fro, and other Vermin follow these trails, much like Earth ants' pheromones. Could these creatures be descended from insects?\n\n* The Vermin are weak individually, and thus live in communal dens, typically buried in hillsides or foxholes.\n\n* Their terrible odor cannot be understated. Even through our suits' filters, we could still smell a foul odor, reminiscent of rotting flesh and excrement. I will not have Tharson disable his filters, despite my curiosity.",

Their major difference, of course, was their ability to fly! I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Pest\".\n\n* Much like their earthbound cousins, the Pests are blind and rely heavily on their smell and hearing. However, their pronounced tongue may indicate that they may use taste to identify things as well.\n\n* The Pests' primary characteristic is their ability to fly. Alongside this, they also weaponize their acidic bile as a projectile attack. This could allow them to partially digest their prey as they hunt... How fascinatingly foul.\n\n* They typically inhabit warmer, damper areas, like jungles. After our skirmish, I noted nests in the canopy. This indicates that the Pests are ambush predators, waiting for prey to waltz below their nests.",

The dunepeople, hungry and battered from life in the harsh desert, accepted.\n\nThe Tar didn't ask for much. The Tar only asked that the dunepeople spread it across Aphelia, so the Tar may feed. And so it did; the dunepeople crafted elaborate clay vessels to carry the Tar to and fro. Mighty aqueducts, belching forth black rivers of Tar, dotted the skyline. Those who pleased the Tar were blessed with its gift; a connection. They were one with the Tar.\n\nAnd it was in this reverence that the dunepeople began to look back. The lush riversides, consumed. The animals that served as livestock and steed, drowned in Tar. The Tar had consumed everything, even the dunepeople themselves. They were nothing more than extensions of the Tar's will.\n\nAnd when the Tar asked for more, the dunepeople had nothing more to give.\n\nOnly a mighty hero, riding down from heaven on a glowing blue dragon, offered the dunepeople a chance at salvation.

Tharson was left mostly unscathed from this encounter, though is reporting signs of dizzyness.\n\n* The Gup's slime is intensely aromatic, smelling much like strawberry and other fruits. Could this be a hunting tactic, luring prey in, only for them to be stuck in the Gup's slimy trap?\n\n* I had Tharson taste-test the Gup's slime, for science. Tharson reported an intensely bitter flavor, despite the pleasant aroma. Tharson is vomiting after this encounter, but is largely OK.",

I've noted some specimens capable of producing blasts of acid with a range of up to 3 meters in diameter.\n\n* When they burst, their acid provides an avenue for newly hatched larvae to bury into prey and feast on their nutrient-rich meat.\n\n* Their acute senses prevent predators from sneaking up on them. On top of this, the creatures exhibit automimicry, their false head spewing acidic bile onto would-be attackers, leaving enough time for the Tick to escape.",

We've recovered only one of the corpses, and it looks like your basic lemurian, other than its mangled limbs and smashed in skull.  I've contacted Tharson to let him know that it'd be worth checking out,  I sure as hell know I'm not going to head into those enclaves while this wild civil war is going on.  Maybe this is just what lemurians get like when they have rabies, though its the first instance I've ever seen of something like rabies out here.\r\n\r\n-- 1/25 --\r\n\r\nFamilial in-fighting has gotten significantly worse.  Often the bouts last for much longer than only one kill now, and the factions seem to change erratically, as if driven by some sort of twisted bloodlust.  A group of 4 will be thrashing an individual to death, only to to turn their hatred toward another in the group soon afterwards.  This is the first time I've seen small groups totally wipe themselves out, only for the last one standing to hobble away on shattered legs.  I don't dare fire from my post, they don't seem interested in us and I'd like to keep it that way.  As far as I'm concerned, these neighbors of ours could drive themselves into extinction and it'd be a good day for me.  Atleast then I could sleep without worrying about the tent burning down every night.\r\n\r\n-- 2/?? --\r\n\r\n> AUDIO RECORDING RECOVERED FROM SITE 4A\r\n\r\nOkay... okay...  Here, damned thing just record!  Just record!  Okay... light on?!  Good - okay.  Listen, this is [REDACTED], I want whoever finds this or finds me or my corpse or [REDACTED]'s corpse to know that I didn't go crazy.  Oh god... Okay, I just murdered [REDACTED].  Atleast, I think it was [REDACTED], it's very confusing.  Something like [REDACTED] was hobbling around the outpost at night - he moved like he didn't have bones or something - it doesn't matter.  I shouted out to him and he turned to fire his weapon toward me in the dark.  I dropped him dead and ... look I can't - if... if we're going to start doing this I just - I have to get out of here.  I just want you to know I'm not crazy.\r\n\r\n-- End of Recording --\r\n\r\n> Involved parties have been removed from record.\r\n\r\n\r\n>Full recording may be accessed on a need-to-know basis in report 596f757220707269736f6e.\r\n==================================================================",

From what I’ve heard about this planet, it could have been worse. We’re surviving on plants our xenobiologist would have loved to study. Some sort of High Court signal is surveying this hell hole. Seems like a stretch, but I hope they look this way and are feeling generous.\nThrough trial and error, we discovered the most edible plant - they’re disgusting raw, but after a sear they’re tolerable, and their smell - a smell so sweet and powerful it saturates our filters. Reminds me of strawberries. Warmed in the sun.\nAt least we’re alive.\n\nDay 03\nMy mouth tastes bitter unless I’m eating. Garret reports the same, his paranoia grows daily. He swears he sees the sap quiver and bounce every time we hack open these plants.\n\nDay 07\nTo be honest I’m starting to worry.\nMore exhausted each day.\nTerrible stomach aches at night.\nOf course we suspect the food but what other choice do we have?\nMy skin has an orange tint to it... maybe it’s my vision.\nAll I smell lately is the sweetness of the sap.\nI pray I’m not getting sick.\nI’d hate for Garret to be right about something.\n\nDay 08\nWe’re alive.\nI’m filled with hope.\nA High Court scout... or did she say seeker? Whatever she is, found our camp. A bit sharp around the edges but gave us some food. I savored every bite. She said it’s not safe to travel at night and will lead us out of this mess in the morning.\nUnderground.\nWith real food to eat.\n\nKelvin out.",

A thorn for each fate changed.\nMany thorns and fates later, he tap tap taps a silver tool against the stone of the workshop.\nRed coils in the window shift again, a massive burning eye curiously takes in the room, then it’s open mouth appears in the window, the sudden heat wave sending a song through a ceiling of silver chimes.\nHe places the spiked obsidian ball inside and pats it’s muzzle twice. The gilded worm is to take the mace to the surface. The obsidian cools in a shaft of putrid moonlight, collecting lunar rage and loneliness.\nFor the handle, he wraps a rod of silver in dried kifruit skins and an eon of freedom, lost to gravity wells long ago.\nFinally, he seals the obsidian weapon with a golden T emblem.\nHis gift.

Even through gloves, the coin burns colder than ever. I’m terrified and compelled to place the coin on the pod, it snaps open.\nA dark gel oozes out, carrying a round device and tablet to my feet. The device activates and pulls the tablet with it into a hover. A construct? I know I should have shot it down, but I… feel it wants to help me get stronger.\nI touch the construct. Thousands of years push their way into my skull, the mounting pressure makes me howl in a voice I don’t recognize, then nothing.\n---\nA pounding migraine wakes me. Midday. I feel moss under me and shield my eyes against the canopy light. I am closer to RallyPoint, but how? Disfigured beetles lay dead in a radius around me, faces distorted, limbs bent. I vomit. The construct hovers protectively nearby. How did it do this?\nDay 2\nStudying the tablet brings no comfort. I worry about Huang. The isolation grates on me, I’m exhausted, hungry, angry. I finally found a supply chest but the construct absorbed my coin before I could use it. This lowly thing thinks it knows best. I don’t know what came over me but I attacked the construct. It didn’t seem to mind but that only made me feel worse. I am not myself.\nDay 3\nThe full moon’s light makes me itch. It pursues me from it’s dark sea, sluggish and unnerving. I stare into it, nearly falling into it’s gaze. For hours I run terrified in the wrong direction. I cannot face it, not how I am. Under a deep canopy I draw familiar power from the construct. Inky feathers break through the skin of my arms and hands. I black out.\nDay 4\nThat blasted thing isn’t cheap, the construct is obsessed with coin, but I can’t argue with the results.

There are structures here, but who built them in these conditions?\nA distant grating noise continues to reach our camp in the night, unnerving me. I wake Tharson to investigate. We find it, at last!\nNearly the size of OMEGA’s Progenitor Leech. Burning, of course.\nI watch in fascination as it crunches effortlessly into thin golden veins of material hidden in the rock.

While effective, I'm not certain if this aura effect is transmitting anything at all. It might all be placebo; people could just be reacting to the spectacle of a cute lifeform putting on a light show in front of them.\r\n\r\nEither way, it's good to have them around, and I think they enjoy being around us too.

Then he said slowly, \"No. You are wrong, sir. The Bighorn Bison is not the most dangerous big game.\" He sipped his wine. \"Here in my preserve on this planet,\" he said in the same slow tone, \"I hunt more dangerous game.\"\n\n\"...Sir?\" General Hadbury turned to Rainsford. \"Tell me, Rainsford, what makes game... dangerous?\" Rainsford thought for a moment. \"...The, er, size, sir? Big animals are often pretty tough to take down.\" Habury nodded. \"Indeed, size can be important, but that's not it. In my eye, what makes game dangerous is... intelligence.\" Hadbury met Rainsford's gaze with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"The best hunt is always a match of wits. Say I were to lay some traps - how would I go about disguising them so that my prize won't spot them from a mile away? It makes things so much more fun, you see.\" Hadbury turned, walking towards the railing of the balcony overlooking his reserve. \"There's no fun to the hunt, or any game for that matter, if there is no risk involved... if there is no story to the prize. That is why, dear Rainsford, my halls are decorated with the spoils of hunts that could only be described as legendary.\" Hadbury's red-lipped smile grew into a red-lined grin. \"Now get the men ready, for we are going to hunt.\"",

While disembarking and setting up a rallypoint, we came under attack from local fauna, just as reports detailed. The situation quickly escalated, and within the first 24 hours we have sustained major casualties and injuries.”\r\n\r\n “Thankfully the ammunition and armaments I requested were granted by UES, as more of the crew has reported back that all outer life encountered thus far has been hostile. Some of our ground forces have also reported strange and irregular natural phenomenon.”\r\n\r\nThe old man gazes out of the window of his cabin, the moon shining in the night sky. “What a strange planet.

The currents of the slipstream were strong - but they were much stronger. With magnetic webs, the newts propelled themselves at amazing speeds. They all swam effortlessly and gracefully – all but one.\r\n\r\nFifty meters behind the pod, a lone newt struggled to keep up. With a defective left arm – atrophied and bent - he didn’t have the same capabilities as his brothers and sisters. \r\n\r\nThe group ignored his struggles as they continued down the stream. Soon, the pod was completely out of sight – and he was all alone, in the darkness of the slipstream.\r\n\r\nSlowly, a smile creeped onto the face of the blind, disfigured newt. Finally. Unbeknownst to his brethren, he knew of a secret place nearby – and he didn’t want them to find out. He dove deep, between two boulders, and into a long, dark tunnel.\r\n\r\nHe passed through the tunnel and surfaced on the other side. Compared to the roaring of the slipstream, this place was seemingly silent. His smile grew wider.\r\n\r\nA tidepool. The tension in the newt’s body began to fade. It’s been a very long day, and he could really use the rest. The tidepool was completely removed from the currents of the slipstream – and from the abuse of his pod. \r\n\r\nHe began to float along the surface. The newt has been here hundreds of times before, but each time he fell deeper and deeper in love. His mind drifted to his experiments – it felt like he was near a breakthrough with some of his tinctures. \r\n\r\nWith his mind preoccupied, he didn’t notice some changes had taken place since his last visit. He didn’t notice that the water levels were a bit higher – and a bit warmer. He didn’t notice that all the flyfish were gone.

The plateau is littered with giant stone rings and arcs - hundreds of feet tall. We investigated them first after landing but we couldn't discern anything of interest.\r\n\r\nWe were making room for a com-center in our camp, and one of our MUL-T bots were in charge of clearing out some of the bigger boulders. It was easiest to just push them off the edge of the plateau. \r\n\r\nNot a minute later, we heard a deep rumble - and saw something unbelievable. It just... flew. One of the stone rings - a smaller one - began to groan and lift out of the earth, moving with unknown forces. And then it lifted into the air, slowly spinning. It hovered to a height of about 200 feet, and then stopped.\r\n\r\nAs it spun, something began to form in the center of the ring. Specks of dirt tumbled in the air, until it formed a pebble, then a small rock, then a boulder. An identical boulder to the one we just moved - created out of thin air. Despite being constructed only a moment ago, the boulder was worn and covered in moss and lichen like it has been around for centuries.\r\n\r\nThen, the stone fell to the ground with an unceremonious crash - right on top of our coms relay.\r\n\r\nNot too long after, the stone ring began to waver. Then, like the invisible strings holding it in place were cut, the ring also fell to the earth.  Crash. \r\n\r\nWe stopped moving stuff around after that.\r\n\r\n<style=cMono>Local audio transcriptions complete.</style>\r\n",

I had no choice. Marion knew - and she was always so much stronger. So much stronger than all of us.\r\n\r\nAnd it worked, it really did! Marion saved all of us. The dagger - it saved Pugh and Larsen and Dillon. Carney and Stevens.\r\n\r\nBut Pugh saw - he saw and he didn't understand. How could he? I tried to tell him - I ran over to him. But I couldn't convince him otherwise, and he was so crazy - so crazy! He wouldn't shut up and the golems were coming and the dagger - there was no choice.\r\n\r\nEveryone was real somber that night. We lost Hitchcock and Marion and Pugh. Real somber. Later on, Carney found the book from a nearby chest. And it really all made sense - it did! I knew why Marion had that dagger and why I had to be the one to kill her. And Carney? He was too strong. I couldn't risk him not understanding. He wouldn't understand.\r\n\r\nBut Carney was big. Everyone else would've known. So that night, after I killed him, I went and took his body to the Altar. And I hid the Altar - right at the edge of the cliff, between two clusters of roots, in a cave underneath. And in that cave... I worshipped Her Concepts.\r\n\r\nThe rest?
